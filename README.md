## Quickstart (Local Development)
1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Setup Environment Variables**: Create a `.dev.vars` file in the `backend` directory and fill in the required keys for Clerk and Cloudflare. Create a `.env.local` in the `apps/web` directory for frontend variables.
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Install pnpm if you haven't already
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install dependencies for all workspaces
    pnpm install
    ```
4.  **Run Development Servers**:
    ```bash
    # This will start both the backend (Hono/Wrangler) and frontend (Next.js) concurrently
    pnpm dev:all
    ```
5.  Open your browser to the Next.js development server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
