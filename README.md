## Quickstart (Local Development)  
1.  **Clone the repository.**  
2.  **Setup Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the root and fill in the required keys for Clerk, Cloudflare R2, D1, and AI.  
3.  **Install Dependencies**:  
    ```bash  
    # Install pnpm if you haven't already  
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install dependencies for all workspaces  
    pnpm install  
    ```  
4.  **Run Development Servers**:  
    ```bash  
    # This will start both the backend (Hono/Wrangler) and frontend (Next.js) concurrently  
    pnpm dev:all  
    ```  
5.  Open your browser to the Next.js development server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
