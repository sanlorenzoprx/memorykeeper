# Shared Types Guidance

To prevent type duplication and ensure consistency between the Next.js frontend and the Hono backend, all shared data structures **must** be defined in the `packages/types` workspace.

### Example

Instead of defining a `Photo` interface in both the frontend and backend, import it from the shared package:

```typescript
import { Photo } from '@memorykeeper/types';

// Use the Photo type in your code
export default function PhotoCard({ photo }: { photo: Photo }) {
  // ...
}
```

File to reference for existing types: @packages/types/index.ts
